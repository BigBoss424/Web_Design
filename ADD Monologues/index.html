      <p>I always seem to forget how to use this site at times especially when it comes to just simply entering p and then tab shortly after to make code simpler to write out. Shorthand if you will. Quite simply my goal is to make these ADD Monologues a blog of sorts tracking my progress learning html and css. So I plan on having a finished product by pen 100. At least that's my goal. So we'll see how far we get. This pen will simply focus on using what I've learned so far to outline the potential site in the future. So let's being!</p>

      <p>This section is suppose to track my progress and random thoughts as I continue to progress. Maybe when I get a little better I'll be able to create a simple segment of code that will better enable me to track my progress. But for now I'll be using the ugly ol (ordered list). </p>
